# Given a 2D matrix nums, return the matrix transposed.
# Note: The transpose of a matrix is an operation that flips each value in the matrix across its main diagonal.

# Ex: Given the following matrix numsâ€¦

# nums = [
#   [1, 2],
#   [3, 4]
# ]
# return a matrix that looks as follows...
# [
#   [1,3],
#   [2,4]
# ]
