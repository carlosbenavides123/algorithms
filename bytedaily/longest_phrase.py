# Given an array of words, return the length of the longest phrase, containing only unique characters, that you can form by combining the given words together.

# words = ["the","dog","ran"], return 9 because you can combine all the words, i.e. "the dog ran" since all the characters in the phrase are unique.
# Ex: Given the following wordsâ€¦

# words = ["the","eagle","flew"], return 4 because "flew" is the longest phrase you can create without using duplicate characters.
